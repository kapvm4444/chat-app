# Chat App

A simple chat application built with modern web technologies. This guide will help you set up the project locally for development or testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommend v16 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kapvm4444/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

If the project uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory. For example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, update the `.env` file with the appropriate values for your environment.

### 4. Start the Development Server

You can now run the app locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server. By default, you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` — Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` — Builds the app for production.
- `npm test` — Runs the test suite.

## Project Structure

A typical structure may look like:

```
chat-app/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── App.js
│   └── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter installation or runtime errors, ensure your Node.js version matches the recommended version.
- Double check your `.env` settings if the app fails to connect to external services.
